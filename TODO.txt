1. Implement the TDBP in bistatic mode
2. Implement the routine that writes a info.txt file containing all the acquisition informations such as:
	PRF,PRI,pulse length, TX gain, RX gain, mode (mono/bist),bandwidth, range samples, azimuth samples, trajectory length, mean velocity of the platform, mean altitude of the platform
3. Implement the saving of all the data in HDF5 file format which is much more flexible and fast than the MAT file format.
4. Function that exports the trajectory into a KML
